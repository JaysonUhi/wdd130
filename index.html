                <p>Hello! My name is Jayson Uhi and I am from Utah. I am currently trying to switch careers and I thought I would finally explore the software side of electronics. I have worked on the hardware side for several years now and I am ready for a change. I hope to be some sort of developer in the future and hope my mechanical background will help me in troubleshooting problems in code. I was a diesel mechanic for 6 years and am most recently classified as an ElectroMechanic. I work on electric vehicles and have thorough knowledge on the technical and hardware sides of electronics. I am hoping that by going back to school and earning a degree, I will be able to have a longer and more rewarding career in the tech field. If I can find a job as a developer, it will allow me to hopefully last longer physically, as being a mechanic can sometimes be a pretty harsh job. I am also hoping that I will be able to spend more time with my family and love what I do and who I work for. Thank you for reading this if you have gotten this far.</p>
